Revision history for OpenTelemetry-SDK

0.025     2024-12-21 10:23:35+00:00 Europe/London

    * Marked OpenTelemetry::Exporter::OTLP as a dependency instead
      of a recommended distribution. Since OTLP is the default
      exporter for the SDK, it doesn't make sense to ship without it.
      The reason it was released as a separate distribution was
      initially because it depended on Google::ProtocolBuffers::Dynamic,
      but now it doesn't: it will use that distribution if it is
      available but use JSON otherwise.
    * BREAKING CHANGE: the SDK will now die if it encounters an error
      during initialisation. This will only affect the code executed
      during import. Once the SDK has been loaded, it will never
      intentionally raise an exception.
    * Add 'isa' as a dependency and reduce the minimum supported Perl
      version to 5.30. If you are running 5.30 please consider installing
      Type::Tiny::XS which should improve the performance of these 'isa'
      checks.

    * Use bigfloat instead of bignum in TraceIDRatioBased sampler
      to avoid complications in other code relaying on Math::BigInt
      and friends. This adds a dependency on Math::BigInt 0.65.
      See GH #16.

0.023001  2024-07-18 10:38:35+01:00 Europe/London (TRIAL RELEASE)

    * Add a `process` method to the Simple and Batch span processors
      to prepare for an upcoming change to the API to support
      OpenTelemetry logs. Their `on_end` methods now are thin wrappers
      to these new methods.

    * Do not call start on the background function in the batch span
      processor, this is handled automatically by the loop (GH #13)

0.021     2023-12-03 14:46:29+00:00 Europe/London

    * Clarify meaning of OTEL_BSP_EXPORT_TIMEOUT in POD
    * Minor correction in Resource POD

0.020     2023-11-26 16:18:52+00:00 Europe/London

    * Switch Metrics::Any client to strict mode, to allow for automatic
      metric name generation. This means the metrics can be exported
      with adapters that don't allow periods (eg. Prometheus). This
      means some metrics had to be renamed:
      - otel.bsp.export.success -> otel.bsp.success
      - otel.bsp.export.failure -> otel.bsp.failure
      - otel.bsp.dropped_spans -> otel.bsp.spans.dropped
      - otel.bsp.exported_spans -> otel.bsp.spans.processed
      - otel.bsp.buffer_utilization -> otel.bsp.buffer.utilization

0.019     2023-11-23 19:31:08+00:00 Europe/London

    * Validate span processors when adding them to the TracerProvider
    * Shutting down a TracerProvider that has been shutdown is not
      en error and no longer warns
    * Add documentation for TracerProvider's add_span_processor
    * Make all shutdown and force_flush methods async for consistency
    * Remove lock from span to avoid running into file descriptor
      limits (GH #8)

0.018     2023-11-21 21:42:57+00:00 Europe/London

    * Ensure shutdown and force_flush calls on the TracerProvider
      wait for the resuts of propagating those calls down to the
      processors
    * Bump minimum version of OpenTelemetry to 0.010 for the
      implementation of the API
    * Fix an issue with reporting dropped spans due to improper
      scalar conversion
    * Fix an issue in the documentation of the OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER
      variable and add some additional details

0.017     2023-11-20 21:37:36+00:00 Europe/London

    * Support recent versions of bignum, which broke
      OpenTelemetry::SDK::Trace::Sampler::TraceIDRatioBased
      (https://github.com/jjatria/perl-opentelemetry-sdk/issues/2)
    * Drop unused dependency on String::CRC32

0.016     2023-11-19 11:42:51+00:00 Europe/London

    * Do not warn if ending an ended span. This is to support the use
      case of a user manually ending the span automatically created by
      the Tracer's in_span method.

0.015     2023-11-17 00:00:04+00:00 Europe/London

    * Fix link to issues in meta

0.014     2023-11-09 00:05:28+00:00 Europe/London

    * Handle more error classes in span's 'record_exception'
    * Add OpenTelemetry::Exporter::OTLP as a recommended distribution

0.013     2023-11-07 20:27:16+00:00 Europe/London

    * Document remaining OTLP exporter environment variables

0.012     2023-11-05 18:33:22+00:00 Europe/London

    * Document environment variables for OTLP exporter

0.011     2023-11-01 23:20:41+00:00 Europe/London

    * Minor cosmetic fixes to documentation to solve some indexing
      problems on CPAN

0.010     2023-11-01 00:00:16+00:00 Europe/London

        First version.
